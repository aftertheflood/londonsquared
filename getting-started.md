## Getting started

The quickest way to get going with this is __via a script tag__ (you'll also need to include D3)

```
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@aftertheflood/londonsquared/dist/index.js"></script>
```

If you're using webpack or something similar to compile your code you can __install bundle the 
via npm__

`npm install @aftertheflood/londonsquared`
